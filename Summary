     ******************************************************* Chapter 1  *******************************************************

*********************************
INTRODUCTORY TERMS AND CONCEPTS *
*********************************

1-Binaries :  The files that can be executed, similar to executables in Windows.
              generally reside in the /usr/bin or usr/sbin directory and include
              utilities such as ps, cat, ls, and cd and the wireless hacking tool aircrack ng and the intrusion
              detection system (IDS) Snort.
2-Case sensitivity : Linux is case sensitive . "And" not like "and" 
3-Directory : same as a folder in Windows. it provides a way of
              organizing files, usually in a hierarchical manner
4-Home : Each user has their own /home directory, when files are created it will be saved by default in home 
5-root : administrator or superuser account like administrator in windows
6-Script : series of commands run in an interpretive environment that converts
           each line to source code.can be run with the bash interpreter 
           or any other scripting language interpreters, such as Python
7-Shell : This is the interpreter for running commands in Linux. The
          most widely used shell is bash
8-Terminal : This is a command line interface (CLI). like cmd in windows

**********************
The Linux Filesystem *
**********************

The Linux filesystem structure is somewhat different from that of Windows. Linux
doesn’t have a physical drive (such as the C: drive) at the base of the filesystem but uses
a logical filesystem instead. At the very top of the filesystem structure is /, which is
often referred to as the root of the filesystem.

**********************

the most important subdirectories to know

/root The home directory of the all powerful root user
/etc Generally contains the Linux configuration files—files that control when and how
programs start up
/home The user’s home directory
/mnt Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the filesystem
/media Where CDs and USB devices are usually attached or mounted to the filesystem
/bin Where application binaries (the equivalent of executables in Microsoft Windows)
reside
/lib Where you’ll find libraries

*************************
BASIC COMMANDS IN LINUX *
*************************

1-pwd : to know where you are
2-whoami : to know which user you are logged in as
3-cd : to change the directory
4-cd.. : to move up one level in file structure
5-cd.. .. : to move up two levels ,and so on cd.. .. ..
6-cd/ : move up to root level
7-ls : list the contents of a directory
8-ls -l : list the contents of a directory with more information 
9-ls-la : list the contents of a directory and hidden files with more information
10- --help ,-h, ?: to get help
11-man : Referencing Manual Pages
12-locate : Followed by a keyword denoting what it
            is you want to find, this command will go through your entire filesystem and locate
            every occurrence of that word. 
13-whereis : to find the Binaries
14-which : is more specific cause it only returns the location of the binaries in
           the PATH variable in Linux
15-find directory options expression : is the most powerful and flexible of the searching utilities
16-ps aux : list of all the processes running in this system
17-cat :  display the contents of the file
18- cat > : create a file
19- cat >> : To add, or append, more content to a file
20-touch : create a new file
21-mkdir : create a new directory
22-cp file /../../.. : copy file to another
23-mv : can be used to move a file or directory to a new location or simply to
        give an existing file a new name
24-rm : to remove a file
25-rmdir : to remove an empty directory
26-rm -r : to remove a directory

     ******************************************************* Chapter  2 *******************************************************
head : to view the beginning of a file c
head - n :  display more lines 
tail : is similar to the head command, but it’s used to view the last lines of a file
nl : To display a file with line numbers
grep : is probably the most widely used text manipulation command. It lets you
       filter the content of a file for display
set : lets you search for occurrences of a word or a text pattern and then
      perform some action on it.
more : displays a page of a file at a time and lets you page down through it using the ENTER key
less : is very similar to more, but with additional functionality—hence

**********************************
ANALYZING NETWORKS WITH IFCONFIG *
**********************************
ifconfig : to get network information
iwconfig : to get information on wireless adapter

***********************************
CHANGING YOUR NETWORK INFORMATION *
***********************************
Changing Your IP Address :--> To change IP address, enter ifconfig followed by the interface you want to reassign
                              and the new IP address you want assigned to that interface
    
   >ifconfig eth0 192.168.161.137
    
Changing Your Network Mask and Broadcast Address :--> ifconfig eth0 192.168.161.137 netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255
                                                      Spoofing Your MAC Address:--> To spoof your MAC address, simply use the ifconfig 
                                                      command’s down option to take down the interface,Then enter the ifconfig command
                                                      followed by the interface name and the new spoofed MAC address.
                                                      Finally, bring the interface back up with the up option for the change to take place.
   >ifconfig eth0 down
   >ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
   >ifconfig eth0 up
   
Assigning New IP Addresses from the DHCP Server:--> To request an IP address from DHCP, simply call the DHCP server with the command
                                                    dhclient followed by the interface you want the address assigned to.
